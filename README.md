## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

In addition, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

You can also watch bite-sized lessons with real-world projects on [Laravel Learn](https://laravel.com/learn), where you will be guided through building a Laravel application from scratch while learning PHP fundamentals.

## Agentic Development

Laravel's predictable structure and conventions make it ideal for AI coding agents like Claude Code, Cursor, and GitHub Copilot. Install [Laravel Boost](https://laravel.com/docs/ai) to supercharge your AI workflow:

## Getting Started Locally

These instructions help you clone the project and run it on another machine.

### Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yuzeyu115-arch/simrs-rsud-malang.git
cd simrs-rsud-malang
```

### Install PHP dependencies

Make sure you have PHP, Composer, and a local database installed. Then run:

```bash
composer install
```

### Copy environment file

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

### Generate application key

```bash
php artisan key:generate
```

### Configure database

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=simrs_rsu
DB_USERNAME=root
